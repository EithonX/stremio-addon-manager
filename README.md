**Stremio Addon Manager** is a modern, secure, and responsive web application that allows you to easily reorder and manage your Stremio addons. 

Stremio natively locks addons in the order of installation. To move a catalog up, users typically have to uninstall and reinstall everything. This tool solves that problem with a simple **Drag-and-Drop** interface.

- **📱 Fully Responsive:** Works perfectly on Desktop, Tablets, and Mobile phones.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EithonX/stremio-addon-manager.git
   cd stremio-addon-manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```


### Local Development

Because this project uses a Cloudflare Worker (Function) to handle CORS securely, you cannot just use `npm run dev`. You must use **Wrangler** to simulate the production environment.

1. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```


2. **Run the local server:**
```bash
npx wrangler pages dev dist
```


Open your browser to `http://localhost:8788`.

## 🌐 Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)

This project is optimized for **Cloudflare Pages**.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and go to **Workers & Pages**.
3. Click **Connect to Git** and select your repository.
4. Use the following Build Settings:
* **Framework Preset:** Vite
* **Build Command:** `npm run build`
* **Output Directory:** `dist`


5. Click **Save and Deploy**.

*Note: The `functions/api` directory will automatically be detected and deployed as a secure proxy.*

## 🔑 How to Get Your AuthKey

If you prefer not to enter your password, you can manually retrieve your AuthKey:

**On Desktop (PC/Mac):**

1. Log into [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com).
2. Open Developer Tools (`F12`).
3. Go to the **Console** tab, paste this, and hit Enter:
```js
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("profile")).auth.key
```



**On Mobile:**

1. Open Stremio Web in Chrome.
2. Type `javascript:` in the URL bar.
3. Paste this code immediately after and hit Enter:
```js
(t=document.createElement("textarea"),t.value=JSON.parse(localStorage.profile).auth.key,document.body.append(t),t.select(),document.execCommand("copy"),t.remove())
```
